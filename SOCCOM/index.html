	<h1>SOCCOM Work</h1>

			<p,style= 'font-size: 35pt'> During my time as a research assistant to Lynne Talley, the head of Observations for the SOCCOM project, I have managed
				three different projects pertaining to the organization and cataloguing of the research cruises from which SOCCOM floats
				were deployed. This experience has allowed me to learn myriad skills relating to research cruises and data management, as
				well as organization and coding skills. I have also developed the ability to collaborate between multiple institutions, seeing as 
				SOCCOM is a project involving not only Scripps Institution of Oceanography (SIO) but also Princeton, Monterey Bay Aquarium Research
				Institution (MBARI), University of Washington, Oregon State University, and others. My time as part of SOCCOM has been a priceless
				education in how research operations work, and I was also exposed to many caring mentors who dedicated time to teaching me.</p>
