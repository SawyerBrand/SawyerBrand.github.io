			<p>I am a PhD student studying physical oceanography at <a href="https://scripps.ucsd.edu/">Scripps Institution of Oceanography</a> with
			<a href="http://pordlabs.ucsd.edu/sgille/">Sarah Gille</a> and <a href="http://sam.ucsd.edu/talleyhome.html">Lynne Talley</a>.
			I use a combination of numerical models, observations, and remote sensing to investigate the role of the ocean in climate. I am 
			particularly interested in Southern Ocean dynamics, including: air-sea-ice interactions, transport of heat and nutrients via the
			meridional overturning circulation, and physical controls on biogeochemistry.</p>

			<p> My pursuit of science has always been strongly rooted in a desire to impact society. Therefore, I am also very passionate about 
			communicating climate science to the general public. As an undergraduate, I interned at the NYC Mayor's Office of Sustainability helping design 
			<a href="http://www1.nyc.gov/site/greenyc/index.page">public education campaigns</a> on issues related to energy efficiency, and served as 
			content manager for a popular science blog called the <a href="https://columbiasciencereview.com/">Columbia Science Review</a>. Currently
			I write for <a href="https://oceanbites.org/author/cprend/">Oceanbites</a>, an online publication that translates recent oceanographic literature
		        for general audiences, and am a member of the 2019 cohort of AGU <a href="https://blogs.agu.org/sciencecommunication/prend-2/">Voices for Science</a> Advocates.</p>
