 <p style="font-size:15pt;"> During my time at Scripps Institution of Oceanography, I was lucky enough to be a part of a major
	 that began accepting students for the first time during my Sophomore year. There are many upsides to being part of a very new major, 
	 but there were many downsides, too, since it takes years for all the issues in a major to be addressed. Because I didn't have time to 
	 wait around for years, I began to advocate for changes within my major. While I pushed for many improvements, including the completion of 
	 a proposal for the Honors program, I spent most of my energy pushing for more programming education requirements and choices in the major. 
	 Since these changes couldn't happen fast enough for the students that were going to graduate with me, I decided to start my own programming 
	 boot camp (of a sort). I am by no means an expert, but I have a few years of experience using python and matlab almost daily. I chose to 
	 create <a href="https://github.com/SawyerBrand/Python-Lessons-for-OAS-Students">Jupyter notebooks</a> that were available to my peers via zoom
	classes at the very beginning of the COVID-19 quarantine. The longer online learning went on, the more difficult it was to be organized about 
	programming help, but these "classes" will return on October 15th, 2020. </p>
