	<h1>Research</h1>
			<div>
			<p style="font-size:17px" > For the past few years, I have been working on a series of projects involving BGC Argo floats in the Argentine Basin. From this, 
				a <a href="/Research/res"> paper</a></li> on the deep waters of the SAMOC in the Argentine Basin has been written (on track to submit October 1st, 2020)
				which is my first lead author scientific paper. Once this paper is submitted, I will be focusing on a <a href="/Research/upcoming_Res"> new research project</a></li>t 
				in the Argentine Basin - exploring how the Malvinas-Brazil Confluence affects gas exchange between the atmosphere and the ocean - most 
				specifically pCO2. I am also fortunate enough to be able to share what I have learned in my few years of research experience
				with a fellow undergraduate, Carson Black, as a coauthor on his <a href="/Research/cars_res"> new technical paper</a></li> exploring how the B-SOSE climate model can be used 
				to QC BGC Argo data more efficiently. </p>
