<h1> Coauthor on Technical Paper about QCing Argo Floats: </h1>

<p> I have been fortunate enough to be given the position of co-author on the technical paper being researched by a fellow OAS senior (Carson Black), along with 
  Matthew Mazloff of SOCCOM. This research will hopefully lead to a procedure we can all follow to utilize climate models in better quality-controlling BGC Argo 
  data. </p>
<p> While my position is mostly as a reference for the Python language and to contribute any knowledge I have of BGC Argo floats (which I have used for research 
  and during my position as a research assistant), I do contribute ideas to the paper and explore the ideas slightly on my own. </p>
