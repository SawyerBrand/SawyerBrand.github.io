<h1> Work as a coauthor on technical paper about QCing Argo Floats: </h1>

<p> I have been fortunate enough to be given the position of co-author on the technical paper being research by a fellow OAS senior (Carson Black), along with 
  Matthew Mazloff of SOCCOM. This research will hopefully lead to a procedure we can all follow to utilize climate models in better quality-controlling BGC Argo 
  data. </p>
