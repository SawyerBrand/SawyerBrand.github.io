			<p style="font-size:17px"> When I first began my research as an undergraduate, I wanted to do a paper inspired by the 
				<a href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/2018GL078013">Gray et al., 2018</a></li> paper
				using BGC Argo floats to examine outgassing of CO2 in the Southern Ocean. I had chosen the area I wanted to work in (the 
				Argentine Basin) because of the presence of the Malvinas-Brazil Confluence, which I thought would have an interesting affect
				on the uptaking and outgassing of the ocean. To do so, I began to familiarize myself with the Argo floats themselves, specifically 
				SOCCOM's BGC Argo (see figure to the left). While looking at these floats, however, I found a couple of extremely low dissolved oyxgen
				progiles (the low values were found below 1400 m in the profiles). With time, my PI (Lynne Talley) and I decided these anomalies would 
				be my new focus (for the time being).</p>

			<p style="font-size:17px"> By the end of my research, I had found 4 profiles that were anomalous relative to the deep water density 
				range on which they were found (see figure on the right). These anomalies were on average -13.9 micromols/kg dissolved oxygen, 
				-1.9 degrees C, and -0.3 psu compared to the other profiles taken by the SOCCOM floats. While 3 possible source waters were 
				identified (Southeast Pacific, South Indian, and Subtropical Atlantic oceans) an isopycnal analysis of the pathways and a 
				reverse trajectory analysis performed on Argo floats showed that only the Southeast Pacific was a viable option. 
				
				We are currently exploring possible mechanisms for the explicit pathway from the Southeast Pacific and expect to submit 
				a paper on the topic to GRL by early November, 2020.
